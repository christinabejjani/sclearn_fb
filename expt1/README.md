# Experiment 1

To assess how performance feedback affects the learning of associations between specific stimuli and control demands, we devised a picture-word item-specific proportion congruent (ISPC) Stroop task. In this task (Figure 1), image categories served as implicit probabilistic cues that predicted the likelihood of conflict-control demand: half of the images were more likely to appear with an incongruent overlaid distractor word (low proportion congruent; e.g., DEER on a picture of a bear), while the others were more likely to appear with a congruent overlaid distractor word (high proportion congruent; e.g., BEAR on a picture of a bear).

This ISPC paradigm avoids stimulus-response learning confounds, because the task-relevant targetimage, rather than the distracter word, predicts congruency (cf. Bugg et al., 2011). Specifically, contingency-learning accounts assume that people learn to modulate word reading or use the response most often associated with specific words as behavioral short-cuts; however, when the target-relevant dimension acts as the signal of proportion congruency, proportion congruency is not confounded with contingency, because the word associations are then equally predictive across all combinations of congruency and proportion congruency.

In the final run of the task, we tested whether these learned associations between image categories and control-demand also transferred to unbiased category exemplars, which were not predictive of proportion congruency. Transfer is not crucial for understanding the effect of performance feedback on the ISPC, but is likely dependent on the strength of the ISPC effect due to its reliance on the category-level association (cf. Bugg & Dey, 2018). Crucially, in one group of participants, this task was administered without trial-by-trial feedback on response accuracy (Figure1a), while for another group such feedback was supplied (Figure1b).

Given that the ISPC effect is thought to reflect learned reactive control (e.g., Bugg, 2017), which in other contexts has been suggested to be insensitive to reward (Braver, 2012), we anticipated observing an ISPC effect of similar magnitude in bothfeedback groups. However, another plausible possibility is that, like most instances of associative learning, the acquisition of stimulus-control associations underlying the ISPC would benefit from performance feedback, which in turn would predict a larger ISPC effect for the feedback vs. no feedback group. Irrespective of these rival hypotheses, for the no feedback group, we expected to replicate previous ISPC studies, showing an interaction between proportion congruent (PC) and congruency whereby congruency effects are reduced for low PCrelative to high PC images.
