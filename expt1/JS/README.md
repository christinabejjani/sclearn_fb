*Please contact me at christina.bejjani AT duke.edu if you are planning on using this code for an experiment.* 

E1a was run in January 2019 on Amazon Mechanical Turk. E1b was run in June 2019 on MTurk. Files that are common to both are listed here (e.g., the task stimuli, jquery, etc.). The Main Menu files in E1a can also be used for E1b (so I didn't upload them twice).

If I had infinite time, I would have made this code more efficient. For example, I would've gotten rid of all the code that is currently "separate" from the main task code and I would use the same functions for the practice and main task instead of repeating code like that. So you could say there is a lot of extra lines that didn't need to be there if I'd been more dedicated to cleaner expt code.

We counterbalanced across feedback group (no feedback/feedback) and image assignment to congruency context (i.e., so that the bear + bird were both mostly incongruent and mostly congruent at least once). That's why there are 6 versions per feedback group.

To run the experiment, you would download the task folder, put it somewhere where html is public (published on github? dropbox? or if your university has a personal home directory, as Duke does), and list the Main Menu file as the "Survey Link" on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Note that you would have to fill in the parts of the task that I removed - i.e., where it says "LINK HERE."
