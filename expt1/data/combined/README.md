# Data from Expt 1:

* Here, you'll find:
  * the compiled csv data of all participants for the expt (Note: these are not the averaged means, but in fact, include all the trials);
  * the post-test questionnaire csv data from Qualtrics.
  * the wide-form of RT, Accuracy, & Inverse Efficiency mean data to input into JASP or SPSS
  
  Expt = 0 means that it is referring to 1a and Expt = 1 means that it is referring to 1b. I renamed the participants so that 1-30 were the same, but 30-60 from E1a became 90-120 in the combined analysis, and 1-60 from E1b became 31-90 in the combined analysis, and 60-120 became 121-180 in the combined analysis. This is to preserve the structure that the first group of subjects = No Feedback and the second group = Feedback, with breaks indicating the different block orders.
