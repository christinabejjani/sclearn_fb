*Please contact me at christina.bejjani AT duke.edu if you are planning on using this code for an experiment.* 

This experiment was run in January 2019 on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

If I had infinite time, I would have made this code more efficient. For example, I would've made each version its own thing; I'd have replaced my if statements within each version so that there are fewer lines that aren't relevant to a particular task version's code.

We counterbalanced across feedback group (no feedback/feedback) and block order (MC-MC-MIC-MIC vs. MIC-MIC-MC-MC). That's why there are 2 versions per feedback group.

To run the experiment, you would download the task folder, put it somewhere where html is public (published on github? dropbox? or if your university has a personal home directory, as Duke does), and list the Main Menu file as the "Survey Link" on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Note that you would have to fill in the parts of the task that I removed - i.e., where it says "LINK HERE."
