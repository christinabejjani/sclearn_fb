# Data from Expt 2:

* Here, you'll find:
  * the compiled csv data of all participants for the expt (Note: these are not the averaged means, but in fact, include all the trials);
  * the post-test questionnaire csv data from Qualtrics.
  * the wide-form of RT, Accuracy, & Inverse Efficiency mean data to input into JASP or SPSS. Note that it says "inverseefficiency" only, but the RT & acc data are also in that csv file.
