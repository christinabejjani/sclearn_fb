# Analysis of Expt 2:

* Here, you'll find:
  * the Jupyter notebook that has ALL analyses reported in the manuscript plus some exploratory analyses not reported (and all the figures that were generated in the paper are here)
  * any np2 values reported in a manuscript were generated through JASP (to double check the values I got in the notebook)
